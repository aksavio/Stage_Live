[00:57.98]On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
[01:04.20]Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
[01:10.50]Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
[01:14.41]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
[01:17.44]I had to stop for the night
[01:20.33]There she stood in the doorway
[01:23.39]I heard the mission bell
[01:27.22]And I was thinking to myself
[01:30.08]"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
[01:36.44]Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
[01:40.31]There were voices down the corridor
[01:42.60]I thought I heard them say
[01:47.40]Welcome to the Hotel California
[01:51.93]Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
[01:56.85]Such a lovely face
[02:00.47]Plenty of room at the Hotel California
[02:05.80]Any time of year (Any time of year)
[02:10.12]You can find it here
[02:15.37]Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
[02:21.43]She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
[02:28.62]How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
[02:35.19]Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
[02:38.26]So I called up the Captain
[02:41.57]"Please bring me my wine."
[02:48.01]He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine."
[02:54.47]And still those voices are calling from far away
[02:58.69]Wake you up in the middle of the night
[03:01.59]Just to hear them say
[03:06.59]Welcome to the Hotel California
[03:10.97]Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
[03:15.03]Such a lovely face
[03:24.02]They livin' it up at the Hotel California
[03:26.47]What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
[03:28.32]Bring your alibis
[03:31.61]Mirrors on the ceiling
[03:34.26]The pink champagne on ice
[03:39.18]And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
