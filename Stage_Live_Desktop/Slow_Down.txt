I see you running, chasing dreams you can’t define
A bigger house, a better car, still searching for a sign
You’re up at dawn and work so late, peace seems far away,
But tell me deep in your heart , can you hear Him say?
Why wake so early, work so late, if your heart’s not set on Him?
Seek first His Voice-His Truth His righteousness,
The treasures of this world will fade, but His Word never will,
Stop trying, just step back, & let true life begin
I’ve been there too ,the grind ,the goals, the climb
I lost myself in deadlines, thought I’d catch up over time
But God stepped in, His Grace opened up my eye
Now I’m here to tell you there’s more to life
Slow Down… Let me be your rest
Your first, your last & best
Slow Down ….. for you I gave my life
don’t waste your life away
Slow Down
