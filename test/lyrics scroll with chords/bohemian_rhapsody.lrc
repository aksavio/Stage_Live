Is this the real life?
[00:12.50]
Is this just fantasy?
[00:15.50]Bb6
Caught in a landslide,
[00:18.00]C7
No escape from reality.
[00:21.00]
[00:22.50]Gm
Open your eyes,
[00:24.50]Cm7
Look up to the skies and see,
[00:28.00]F7
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
[00:32.00]Bb      Eb        Bb        Eb
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
[00:35.00]Bb      Fm7       Bb
Little high, little low,
[00:38.50]Eb          Bb/D         C#dim       F7/C
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.
[00:44.00]
[00:55.50]Bb
Mama, just killed a man,
[00:59.00]Gm
Put a gun against his head,
[01:01.00]Cm
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
[01:04.50]Bb
Mama, life had just begun,
[01:08.00]Eb              Bb/D
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
[01:12.50]
[01:13.00]Eb    Bb/D  Cm
Mama, ooh,
[01:16.50]Fm          C+       Eb
Didn't mean to make you cry,
[01:19.50]Bb
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
[01:22.50]Gm          Eb          Bb
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.
[01:28.00]
[01:30.00]Fm  C+  Fm  C+
Too late, my time has come,
[01:33.00]Fm7             Bb7
Sends shivers down my spine,
[01:35.50]Eb
Body's aching all the time.
[01:39.00]Db/Ab         Abm6        Gbdim
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
[01:43.00]Bb7sus4      Bb7       Eb
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
[01:48.00]
[01:48.50]Cm    Gm
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows),
[01:52.00]Eb/G   Fm
I don't wanna die,
[01:55.00]Bb7                          Eb
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
[02:00.00]
[02:35.00]A     D/A   A   E/A A
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
[02:38.00]A           D/A       A         D/A
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
[02:42.00]C#m/G#  G#   C#m/G# G#
Thunderbolt and lightning,
[02:44.00]C#m   G#7       C#m
Very, very frightening me.
[02:46.50]A

Galileo Figaro

Magnifico-o-o-o.
[02:56.00]
[02:57.00]Eb        Bb/D          Eb         Bb/D
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me.
[03:00.00]Ab/Eb       Eb            Bb
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
[03:03.00]Ab/Eb         Eb              Fm7
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.
[03:06.50]
[03:07.50]C             G/B           Am
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
[03:10.00]Bb                                F
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)
[03:13.00]Bb                                F
Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!)
[03:15.00]Bb            F
Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!)
[03:17.00]Bb            F
Will not let you go. (Let me go!)
[03:19.00]Bb          F
Never, never let you go. (Never let me go!)
[03:21.00]Bb F
Never let me go, oh.
[03:23.00]N.C.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:26.00]
[03:27.00]A   D     G       C
Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go.)
[03:30.00]G                         D7sus4              G
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!
[03:38.00]
[03:40.00]Bbmaj7
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
[03:43.00]Ebmaj7
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
[03:46.50]Fm7
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
[03:50.00]Fm7
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.
[03:57.00]
[04:05.00]Bb   F
Nothing really matters,
[04:08.00]Gm
Anyone can see,
[04:11.00]Eb   Bb
Nothing really matters,
[04:15.00]Cm7              F7sus4  Bb
Nothing really matters to me.
[04:20.00]
[04:22.00]
Any way the wind blows.
