[00:10.50]Is this the real life?
[00:12.50]Is this just fantasy?
[00:15.50]Caught in a landslide,
[00:18.00]No escape from reality.
[00:21.00]
[00:22.50]Open your eyes,
[00:24.50]Look up to the skies and see,
[00:28.00]I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
[00:32.00]Because I'm easy come, easy go,
[00:35.00]Little high, little low,
[00:38.50]Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.
[00:44.00]
[00:55.50]Mama, just killed a man,
[00:59.00]Put a gun against his head,
[01:01.00]Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
[01:04.50]Mama, life had just begun,
[01:08.00]But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
[01:12.50]
[01:13.00]Mama, ooh,
[01:16.50]Didn't mean to make you cry,
[01:19.50]If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
[01:22.50]Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.
[01:28.00]
[01:30.00]Too late, my time has come,
[01:33.00]Sends shivers down my spine,
[01:35.50]Body's aching all the time.
[01:39.00]Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
[01:43.00]Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
[01:48.00]
[01:48.50]Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows),
[01:52.00]I don't wanna die,
[01:55.00]I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
[02:00.00]
[02:35.00]I see a little silhouetto of a man,
[02:38.00]Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
[02:42.00]Thunderbolt and lightning,
[02:44.00]Very, very frightening me.
[02:46.50](Galileo) Galileo,
[02:48.50](Galileo) Galileo,
[02:50.00]Galileo Figaro
[02:52.50]Magnifico-o-o-o.
[02:56.00]
[02:57.00]I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me.
[03:00.00]He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
[03:03.00]Spare him his life from this monstrosity.
[03:06.50]
[03:07.50]Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
[03:10.00]Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)
[03:13.00]Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!)
[03:15.00]Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!)
[03:17.00]Will not let you go. (Let me go!)
[03:19.00]Never, never let you go. (Never let me go!)
[03:21.00]Never let me go, oh.
[03:23.00]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:26.00]
[03:27.00]Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go.)
[03:30.00]Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!
[03:38.00]
[03:40.00]So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
[03:43.00]So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
[03:46.50]Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
[03:50.00]Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.
[03:57.00]
[04:05.00]Nothing really matters,
[04:08.00]Anyone can see,
[04:11.00]Nothing really matters,
[04:15.00]Nothing really matters to me.
[04:20.00]
[04:22.00]Any way the wind blows.
